What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

 Simulator

 A simulator is a software tool used to simulate and verify the behavior of your digital circuit. It allows you to input test    signals into your design and check the outputs. This ensures that your circuit functions correctly without having to implement  it physically, saving both time and resources.

 Design

 The design refers to your Verilog (or other hardware description language) code that defines the intended logic and             functionality of the digital circuit you want to create.

 Testbench

 A testbench is a special environment or code written to apply different test inputs to the design and observe the outputs. It   helps in verifying if the design works as expected by comparing the generated outputs with the expected results.
