COMBINATIONAL LOGIC OPTIMIZATION

<span style="color:red">This text is red</span>


Combinational logic optimization focuses on minimizing the complexity of the logic circuit in terms of area, power, and delay while maintaining the same functionality. Optimization techniques are applied to reduce the number of gates, minimize gate delays, and lower the overall power consumption of the design.

   1)Constant Propagation (Direct Optimization):

Constant propagation is a form of optimization where constant values are substituted directly into Boolean expressions. This simplifies the design by eliminating variables that have a fixed value.

   2)Boolean Logic Optimization:

Karnaugh Maps (K-map): K-maps are used to simplify Boolean expressions by visualizing them in a two-dimensional grid and grouping together terms that can be simplified.

Quineâ€“McCluskey Algorithm: This is a tabular method for minimization of Boolean expressions. It is particularly useful for Boolean functions with many variables.
