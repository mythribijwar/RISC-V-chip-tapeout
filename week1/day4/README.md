## 1. What is Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)?

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** involves simulating the **post-synthesis netlist** to verify the behavior and timing of your design after it‚Äôs been translated into logic gates.

### üõ† Purpose of GLS

- ‚úÖ Validate that synthesis preserved the design functionality.
- ‚è± Perform timing checks using annotated delays (via SDF files).
- üîç Verify scan chains and DFT (Design for Test) logic.

### üîÑ When is GLS Performed?

- **Post-Synthesis**: After RTL is synthesized into a netlist.
- **Pre-Layout**: Before physical design, to catch functional issues early.

### üß™ Types of GLS

| Type             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional GLS   | Logic-only simulation (zero-delay or unit-delay), no real-world timing.    |
| Timing GLS       | Uses timing annotations to simulate actual delays (SDF back-annotation).    |

## 2. Understanding Synthesis-Simulation Mismatches

A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when the behavior of the RTL simulation doesn't match the behavior of the synthesized netlist (GLS or actual hardware).

### 2.1 Common Causes

- ‚ùå Use of **non-synthesizable constructs**: `initial`, `#delay`, file I/O, etc.
- ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Ambiguous RTL**: Missing `else` branches, incomplete sensitivity lists.
- üõ† **Tool interpretation differences**: Synthesis and simulation tools may interpret loosely-written RTL differently.

---

### 2.2 Missing or Incomplete Sensitivity Lists

Incorrect sensitivity lists in combinational `always` blocks can lead to simulation mismatches, even if synthesis behaves correctly.

#### üß† Why It Matters

- **Simulation** depends on the sensitivity list to know when to re-evaluate the `always` block.
- If not all input signals are included, the block won‚Äôt respond to their changes during simulation.
- This may cause incorrect outputs or behavior that seems like a **latch** or **double-edge-triggered flip-flop**.

#### üß® Example: Incomplete Sensitivity List

```verilog
// Incorrect ‚Äî only 'sel' is in the sensitivity list
always @(sel) begin
  if (sel)
    y = a;
  else
    y = b;
end
```

**Issue**: If `a` or `b` changes while `sel` does not, `y` won‚Äôt update ‚Äî this **can appear** like double-edge-triggered logic during simulation, even though it's not.

#### ‚úÖ Correct Form: Use `@(*)` or full list

```verilog
// Correct ‚Äî automatically includes all RHS signals
always @(*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = a;
  else
    y = b;
end
```

Or older Verilog:

```verilog
always @(a or b or sel)
```

> ‚úÖ `@(*)` is recommended for combinational logic ‚Äî ensures correct simulation behavior and avoids mismatches.

## 3. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog

Verilog provides two assignment types in procedural blocks: **blocking (`=`)** and **non-blocking (`<=`)**. Using them appropriately is crucial for correct synthesis and simulation behavior.

---

### 3.1 Blocking Assignments (`=`)

- **Used in:** Combinational logic.
- **Execution:** Executes sequentially in the order written.
- **Syntax Example:**

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  a = b & c;
  d = a | e;  // 'a' is already updated when this line runs
end
```

---

### 3.2 Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`)

- **Used in:** Sequential logic (flip-flops).
- **Execution:** Schedules the update at the **end** of the current time step.
- **Syntax Example:**

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  q <= d;
end
```

### 3.3 Comparison Table

| **Feature**                                | **Blocking (`=`)**                      | **Non-Blocking (`<=`)**                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Operator                                   | `=`                                     | `<=`                                         |
| Execution Order                            | Immediate, sequential                   | Deferred, parallel (end of time step)       |
| Suitable for                               | Combinational logic                     | Sequential logic (registers)                |
| Simulation Behavior                        | Executes in code order                  | Updates after time step                     |
| Risk of Race Conditions                    | High in sequential logic                | Low                                          |
| Common Usage                               | Temp/intermediate combinational values  | Clocked processes, flip-flops               |

## 4.LAB

### Lab 1: Ternary Operator MUX

Verilog code for a simple 2:1 multiplexer using a ternary operator:

```verilog
module ternary_operator_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output y);
  assign y = sel ? i1 : i0;
endmodule
```
- **Function:** `y = i1` if `sel = 1`; else `y = i0`.

![lab1](https://github.com/mythribijwar/RISC-V-chip-tapeout/blob/139857eb98bb2290e11d427fddb7979b848f246a/week1/day4/pictures/ternary_operator_mux_gtk.png)

---

### Lab 2: Synthesis Using Yosys

Synthesize the above MUX using Yosys.  
_Follow the standard Yosys synthesis flow._

with a extra command
```shell

   write_verilog -noattr ternary_operator_mux_net.v
```

![lab2](https://github.com/mythribijwar/RISC-V-chip-tapeout/blob/139857eb98bb2290e11d427fddb7979b848f246a/week1/day4/pictures/ternary_operator_mux.png)

---

### Lab 3: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of MUX

Run GLS for the synthesized MUX.  
Use this command (adjust paths as needed):

```shell
iverilog /path/to/primitives.v /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v ternary_operator_mux_net.v testbench.v
```

![lab3](https://github.com/mythribijwar/RISC-V-chip-tapeout/blob/139857eb98bb2290e11d427fddb7979b848f246a/week1/day4/pictures/ternary_operator_mux_gtk_check.png)

---

### Lab 4: Bad MUX Example (Common Pitfalls)

Verilog code with intentional issues:

```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
  always @ (sel) begin
    if (sel)
      y <= i1;
    else 
      y <= i0;
  end
endmodule
```

#### Issues:
- **Incomplete sensitivity list**: Should include `i0`, `i1`, and `sel`.
- **Non-blocking assignment in combinational logic**: Should use blocking assignments (`=`).

**Corrected version:**
```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = i1;
  else
    y = i0;
end
```

![lab4](https://github.com/mythribijwar/RISC-V-chip-tapeout/blob/139857eb98bb2290e11d427fddb7979b848f246a/week1/day4/pictures/bad_mux_gtk.png)

---

### Lab 5: GLS of Bad MUX

Perform GLS on the `bad_mux`.  
Expect simulation mismatches or warnings due to above issues.

![lab5](https://github.com/mythribijwar/RISC-V-chip-tapeout/blob/139857eb98bb2290e11d427fddb7979b848f246a/week1/day4/pictures/bad_mux_gtk_check.png)

---

### Lab 6: Blocking Assignment Caveat

Verilog code:

```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
  reg x;
  always @ (*) begin
    d = x & c;
    x = a | b;
  end
endmodule
```

#### What‚Äôs wrong?
- The order of assignments causes `d` to use the old value of `x`‚Äînot the newly computed value.
- **Best Practice:** Assign intermediate variables before using them.

**Corrected order:**
```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  x = a | b;
  d = x & c;
end
```
